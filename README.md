## About
Red Hen’s Rapid Annotator provides a platform to users to annotate large chunks of data in a short span of time and with least possible efforts. It provides the features of annotating images/videos/audios/text during collaborative situation also. With Red Hen Lab’s we will try to enable users to visualize the progress of each annotator separately and annotators can notify experimenter when the annotation is finished to make the annotation work more efficient.
